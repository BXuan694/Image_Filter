__Update 13-05-2017__:   __It's an image filter written by myself.__

## Introduction


There are 11 filters to choose:

 1. Naive_Filter
 2. Sharpness_Center_Filter
 3. Sharpness_Edge_Filter
 4. Edge_Detection_360_degree_Filter
 5. Edge_Detection_45_degree_Filter
 6. Embossing_45_degree_Filter
 7. Embossing_Asymmetric_Filter
 8. Averaging_Blur_Filter
 9. Completed_Blur_Filter
 10. Motion_Blur_Filter
 11. Gaussian_Blur_Filter

Choose the one you need, and the filterred image will generated at folder **Image_Generated**


The filter is consisted of five parts:
* src: folder for the code files that implement the function
* Image_Origin: folder for pictures which be chosen to filtering
* Image_Generated: folder for pictures which be generated after filtering
* README.md: introduce of this program
* requirements.txt: environment required for this program

## Usage 

* run "cd src/" to find code files 
* run "run.sh" to generated the image you need

## Requirements

   * Python2.7

   * Opencv2
